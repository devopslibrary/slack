# DevOpsLibrary Social Hour

## What

An informal gathering of member over voice/video chat that may or may not include any technical discussions.
Okay, it will probably involve technical discussions.
Think of it as a Conference Virtual Hallway Track.

## How

A Master of Ceremonies (MC) is nominated each week. The responsibilities of the MC include:

* Scheduling the meeting
* Making DOL aware of the Schedule
* Selecting the technology for the conversation
* Propose a topic
* Nominating the next MC

### Scheduling

Whenever the MC wants.
Everyone has different schedules and there's no way to accommodate everyone so just do what works for you.
It doesn't have to be an hour.
If all you have is 30 minutes, then make it 30 minutes.

Announce the schedule on `#General` at least once. It's not like we have a shared calender system.

### Technology

Again, not everyone regularly uses the same video chat tools or even any.
The MC should pick something they are familiar with.
It's not about making sure everyone is supported, but that a weekly hangout is available.

## Topic

Whatever, but keep it appropriate.

## Nomination

A side affect of changing the MC weekly is the randomize the event.
As mentioned previously, this will never work for everyone every time.
It's not a formal committee that requires a quorum, it's just a chance to spawn serendipitous conversations with your peers that don't happen as often in text chat.
